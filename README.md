My first attempt to clustering. In this dataset I tried PCA as well as various clustering methods, such as:

 - KMeans
 - Mean Shifting Clustering
 - Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)
 - Expectationâ€“Maximization (EM) Clustering using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
 - Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
